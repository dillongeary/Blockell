# Blockell

Blockell is an online IDE that supports a bespoke Block-Based Functional Programming Language, designed to help teach novice (functional) programmers the basics of functional programming. The IDE supports code editing of a subset of said language, and real time conversion into Haskell.

Future plans for this project are:
- [ ] Expand the scope of the langauge, including but not limited to:
  - [ ] Function Currying
  - [ ] Abstract Typing
  - [ ] Monadic Components
- [ ] Implement Type based syntax highlighting / block coloring
- [ ] Implement a working Interpreter to give real time results

This project originated as part of a Disertation for the award of MEng Computer Science at the University of Southampton, but has since evolved further with development continuing long after graduation.
